# Projects in Python language

- ### "exercises_x4" is the Python translation of my C project of the same name.

- ### "projetMer" is a project, in French, that allows you to obtain underwater information depending on the desired depth. 
  - The codes were created by Jordan and me as part of a group project, containing the following members:
      * [Jordan Lefrançois](https://github.com/jordan0602/jordan0602)
