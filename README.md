# Projects in Python language

### - "exercises_x4" is the Python translation of my C project of the same name.

### - "projetMer" is a folder containing three files in French :
* "abysse_v4" : it's a Python file that is linked to a SQLite database created by a colleague.
* "merSQL" : it's a program that uses data from a database created by the previous file.
* "merSimuSQL" : it's a program that simulates the data that a database would provide.
